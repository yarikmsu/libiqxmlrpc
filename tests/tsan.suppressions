# Suppress races in glibc's internal DNS resolver implementation.
# gethostbyname_r uses __libc_dynarray_emplace_enlarge internally,
# which has shared state that TSan cannot properly track.
# The resolver's internal synchronization is correct, but TSan
# sees the realloc operations on shared buffers as races.
# This is a known limitation with glibc's NSS (Name Service Switch).
