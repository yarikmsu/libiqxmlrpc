# Coding Standards

## Code Quality

- Write clean, readable code with meaningful names
- Prefer simple solutions over clever ones
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when practical
- Avoid over-engineering - only add complexity when needed

## Documentation

- Update documentation when changing behavior
- Keep comments current with code
- Document non-obvious design decisions
- Avoid obvious comments that repeat the code
